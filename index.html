        <h1>Abdul Salim</h1>
        <p>I am passionate about the learning process that comes from the objective of developing software applications.</p>
        <p>I enjoy the productivity and efficiency of developing applications using Python, this has lead me to learn software development practices such as unit testing, version control and continuous integration. At the same time I am open and very much interested in learning other languages and frameworks to broaden my exposure and experience.</p>
