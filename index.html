        <hr />
        <p>Hi, I'm Abdul a software developer and  technical support engineer living in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>I develop applications using Python, mainly because I enjoy its productivity and efficiency. Using Python also taught me a lot of things - I've learned software development practices such as unit testing, version control and continuous integration - topics that I mostly end up <a href="http://blog.fuchida.me">writing </a> about. At the same time, I'm looking to  broaden my exposure and experience with other languages and frameworks.I'm always ready to venture into the unknown when it comes to software development
        </p>
        <p>You take a look at my code on
            <a href="https://github.com/fuchida">Github</a>
            , have a quick conversion with me on
            <a href="http://twitter.com/fuchida_">Twitter</a> or send me an email at
            <a href="mailto:abdlsalim@gmail.com">abdlsalim@gmail.com</a>
