        <p>Hi, I'm Abdul, and I love the learning and problem solving that comes from building software.</p>
        <p>I develop applications using Python, mainly because I enjoy its productivity and efficiency. Using Python also taught me a lot of things - I've learned software development practices such as unit testing, version control and continuous integration - topics that I mostly end up <a href="http://blog.fuchida.me">writing </a> about. At the same time, I'm looking to  broaden my exposure and experience with other languages and frameworks.I'm always ready to venture into the unknown when it comes to software development
